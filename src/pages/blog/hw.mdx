## Hi guys

Today I'm going to show you how to break ShonenJump+.

But before writing all that code, we'll have to take a look at an example.

<img src="https://cdn-ak-img.shonenjumpplus.com/public/page/2/10834108156629439536-33626cf0f0ac52ca1d1e0f5c2bc64396" alt="Example of shuffled panel" class="w-1/3"/>

We can see that we might be able to unpuzzle this by just taking each pieces and putting them in their right place, and that's what I tried to do, but some pieces where bigger than others.

So basically every panels on the website in unpuzzled by a javascript file but we're not going to look at it 'cause it's too big.

What I did instead was searching on Github if anyone already had an idea on how to unpuzzle those because I'm a lazy man.

And I did found a lot of answers, and for this we'll need 2 magic numbers.

<Code code="multiplier = 8" lang="python" inline/> and <Code code="divider = 4" lang="python" inline/>, We'll need those to get values like the height of each rows and their width.

<CodeBlock lang="kotlin" file="/code/shonenjumpplus/full.kt" filename="main.kt"/>
