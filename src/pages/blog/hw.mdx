## Hi guys

Today I'm going to show you how to break ShonenJump+.

But before writing all that code, we'll have to take a look at an example.

(insert example)

We can see that we might be able to unpuzzle this by just taking each pieces and putting them in their right place, and that's what I tried to do, but some pieces where bigger than others.

So basically every panels on the website in unpuzzled by a javascript file but we're not going to look at it 'cause it's too big.

What I did instead was searching on Github if anyone already had an idea on how to unpuzzle those because I'm a lazy man.

And I did found a lot of answers, and for this we'll need 2 magic numbers.

<Code code="multiplier = 8" lang="python" inline/> and <Code code="divider = 4" lang="python" inline/>, We'll need those to get values like the height of each rows and their width.

<CodeBlock lang="kotlin" file="/code/shonenjumpplus/full.kt" filename="main.kt"/>
